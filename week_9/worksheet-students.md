# Week9 Exercise
## Bronze Level


### 1. Copy a string: 

1. Take a string input from the user. 
2. Calculate the length of the input string 'l'.
3. Dynamically allcoate a new array whose length is l+1. 
4. Copy the content of the input string to the new array. 
5. Print the content of the new array.

## Silver Level
### 1. Complete the myprintf() function. 

Modify the myprintf() function to handle %c, %p, %s. 
 

## Gold Level

### 1. Dynamic 3D

Take three integers from user. Dynamically allocate a 3 dimension array A. At A[i][j][k] keep the value (i+1)x(j+1)x(k+1). Print the 3 dimensional array. 

### 2. Flexible 2D

Modify the Dynamic_2d.c file as follows. Modify the implementation of the dynamic 2D array so that you do not have to pass the dimensions of the arrays to the access_2D() and print_2D() function.
